## (1) Description

An 'MS Paint' style app using Fabric.js. This was built with React, Node, Javascript, and CSS. 

Things learned:
- Using Fabric.js, + some experimentation with alternatives: a Paint style app in vanilla JS and in Paper.js (both saved in /copies)
- App which saves content to local machine (saves images)

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/paint.git
cd paint
npm install
npm run start
```

## (5) Usage

Technologies:

- <strong>Fabric.js: </strong> A HTML5 and Javascript Canvas API library for drawing, object and image manipulation. Had to scale back to v4 because of issue with import fabric in v5 & v6.
```bash
import * as fabric from 'fabric'; // v6
import { fabric } from 'fabric'; // v5
```
- ~~<strong>Paper.js: </strong>~~ Alternative to Fabric, canvas and image manipulation Library API. Able to make a paint style app, but lacks features of Fabric out of box.
- Konva:
- Lodash:
- 

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

The main functions of code:

(A) Game: 

(A.1) PoolTable component:

- <strong>'const ...' </strong>: ...
- <strong>'const ....' </strong>: ...
- <strong>'const ...', </strong>: ...

(A.2) Pool component:

- <strong>'const ...' </strong>: ....
- <strong>'useEffect...' </strong>: creates game world.
- <strong>'const ...' 'const ...' </strong>: ...
- <strong>'const ...' </strong>: ...
- <strong>'const ...' </strong>: ...
 
(B) Movement:

## (7) Config

(A) Pocket Sensors:

You can remove:
```bash
const sensorRadius = 10;
```
and 
```bash
        isSensor: true,
        isStatic: true,
```

(B) Change Background:

```bash
          isSensor: true,
```

## (8) Bugs and Further Development:

Optimization:
- use react-virtualized to only render visible stuff
- once game basically running, convert it into Redux or Zustand
- use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to optimize build output: Enable code splitting, tree-shaking, and minification to reduce bundle size and improve load times.
- Consider memoizing components using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if their props rarely change.

## (9) To do: 

- [x] Make Canvas
- [x] Make pencil that draws by toggling and dragging
